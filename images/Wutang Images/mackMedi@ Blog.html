rhymes, charismatic ululations, slightly garbled style, and
unpredictable vocal inflections.

Wu-Tang solo album with Tical. His career is highlighted by platinum
sales and a Grammy for I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By

Nicknamed "The Chef" for having "lyrical flavor". His lyrics contain
extensive use of New York slang, which is often delivered in an
aggressive, fast-paced manner. He is also known for his storytelling
about wealth, power, and prestige.


    Ghostface

Known for his distinctive, abstract, energetic and emotional style of
rapping. He had a large role in Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... and
later released his debut album Ironman to critical acclaim. Mainstream
hip-hop press credits his second album Supreme Clientele with "saving
the Wu.


    Inspectah Deck

rhyme-schemes. He was a popular guest rapper in 1997 and 1998. He is
also a producer, providing beats for artists both in and out of the
Wu-Tang Clan, such as Ghostface Killah, Method Man, Big Pun, Prodigy,
and others.


    U-God

A founding member with his own solo career, U-God's has had a relatively
low profile, in part due to his limited exposure from being incarcerated
for most of the recording of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), in which
he only delivered short verses on "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'" and
"Protect Ya Neck".


    Masta Killa

The only member not already an experienced rapper at the time of the
group's formation, he was extensively mentored by GZA during his early
days with the group. He was largely absent on the group's first album

to the track "Da Mystery of Chessboxin".

After growing up as friends with many of the Clan members, Cappadonna
made his debut as an affiliate of the Wu-Tang Clan on Raekwon's hit
single "Ice Cream". He was also a guest star, along with Raekwon, on
Ghostface Killah's solo debut album, Ironman. He made his first
appearance on a Wu-Tang Clan album in 1997 on Wu-Tang Forever on the
single "Triumph".
